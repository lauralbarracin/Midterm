        <h2>The great debate </h2>
        <p><b> For decades dogs and cats have been the focus of several debates. However, there are a couple of reasons for you to take an informed position on this debate</b></em></p>
        <h3>CATS</h3>
        <p><b>1. Owning a cat might make you more intelligent.</b></p>
        <p>According to 2017 research published in the Human-Animal Interaction Bulletin, self-identified cat lovers tended to have higher intelligence than dog lovers do. (We are less outgoing, though.)</p>
        <b></b>2.They splash less.</b></P>
        <p>As a team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Princeton University revealed in 2010, cats drink water far more efficiently than dogs do.</p>
        <h3>DOGS</h3>
        <p><b>1.Dogs Just Wanna Have Fun</b></p>
        <p>Dogs absolutely love to play, and it's often interactive play that they want, especially with you. You can play fetch with a ball or a disc. You can enjoy an exciting game of tug-of-war. You can play chase in the yard. If your dog gets along well with other dogs, you can even set up a doggie "playdate" with another pup. Just make sure both dogs are healthy and will get along. </p>
        <p><b>Dogs Adapt Better to Change</b></p>
        <p>Cats are usually sensitive to their environments and dislike change. Many dogs tend to accept change more easily, especially when their owners act like it's no big deal. Of course, there are plenty of anxious and fearful dogs out there, but as a species, they're often calmer in the face of significant alterations to their lifestyles. </p>

            <h2>Reality</h2>
            <img src="img/catsdogs1.jpg" alt="friends" width="802" height="623">
            <p> Dogs and cats can become the best of friends, or at least learn to peacefully coexist. If you already have a cat at home and are looking to add a dog, choosing the right breed will go a long way toward a harmonious relationship. Certain breed groups are more likely to get along with cats than others.</p>
            <p>Finally, cats and dogs don't hate each other naturally, they do have different temperaments.</p>
